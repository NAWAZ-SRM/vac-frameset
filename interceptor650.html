      <p>The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 is a parallel twin retro-styled motorcycle introduced by Royal Enfield in
        2018. It is the first modern twin cylinder motorcycle developed by the company.

        In 2017 it was revealed, inspired by the 1960s Interceptor which had a 750cc engine. The Interceptor 650 was
        unveiled alongside the Continental GT 650, which shares the same engine. The Interceptor is a retro-cruiser with
        relaxed ergonomics, while the Continental GT is a caf�-racer with minor changes for performance. Both models are
        sold in India, Australasia, Europe and the United States. The bike is expected to become the biggest selling
        large-capacity twin in the world,[1] and in 2020 the Interceptor 650 was the UK's best-selling big bike.

      <font style="comic sans" size="6" color="maroon">The bike was designed at Royal Enfield's Technology Centre at
        Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground in Leicestershire, England.

        Both models, Interceptor and Continental GT, share the same engine, frame, suspension, wheels, brakes, exhausts
        and silencers. The engine is a wet-sump, 648 cc, air-cooled SOHC, 8v, parallel twin. Fuelling is via Bosch
        injection and engine management. The low 9.5:1 compression ratio will help the engine tolerate lower-octane
        fuel. The crankshaft has a 270� Crank, with a gear-driven balance shaft ahead of the crank. The slipper clutch
        drives a six-speed gearbox and chain final drive. The cylinder head receives substantial oil-cooling and the
        bikes have a large oil cooler on the frame downtubes. Producing a modest 47bhp @ 7250 rpm, the engine is capable
        of future development: Bike magazine reported that "the crankshaft's substantial bearing area and the hefty
        alloy crankcases suggest that the engine could comfortably deliver more power. Compression, capacity and revs
        could be raised on future models".

        The chassis is a tubular twin-downtube cradle frame. Forks are standard telescopics (without gaiters); and rear
        suspension is via twin shocks(5 step adjustable). The ABS brakes comprise single discs: 320mm (front) and 240mm
        (rear). Instruments are conventional twin-dial analogue items with digital fuel gauge and trip display.

      <font style="comic sans" size="6" color="maroon">The Interceptor is a conventionally-styled roadster with dual
        seat, a rounded 13.7 litre saddle tank with a Royal Enfield classic badge and a Monza-style fuel cap. The braced
        handlebars and more forward-set footrests allow a sit-up-and-beg riding position, and a tubular grab-rail is
        fitted for the pillion passenger.
